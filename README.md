Function as a Service (FaaS) platform
The goal of this project is to implement a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform that allows users to run Python functions in a serverless environment using the FastAPI framework for the REST API and ZMQ for communication with a pool of worker processes. It should be optimized for performance to handle many concurrent requests and provide fast response times.
